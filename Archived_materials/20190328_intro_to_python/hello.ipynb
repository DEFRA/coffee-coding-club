    "Hi! And welcome to the Python for Analysts training course. This covers everything you need to know to start using Python for data analysis and visualisation as well as showcasing some more advanced stuff, including Statistics, Machine Learning, Web Scraping / Interaction etc.  \n",

    "The course assumes no prior knowledge of Python and will teach you everything you need to know in order to use Python for data analysis and visualisation, including interfacing with Python via the Jupyter interface, using Text Editors / Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), upgrading Python, working with the command line etc.\n",

    "Lastly, I designed the course to be delivered in a classroom environment, however it's just as easy to go through the course by cloning the github repo and working through the lessons and exercices.\n",

    "One of the first things I noticed about Python was that much of the training out there is geared towards programmers rather than analysts and this made learning more difficult. Additionally much of this assumes knowledge of things like packages, the command line etc. which analysts are less likely to have experience with.\n",
