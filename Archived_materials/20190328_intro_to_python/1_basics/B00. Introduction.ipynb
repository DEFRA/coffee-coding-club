This mean that he was in charge of the development of the language, however this is now handled by a group of core Python developers. Development of Python is done (in conjunction with the user community of course!) via PEPs or Python Enhancement Protocols. You can read these at www.Python.org but two great examples are PEP 8 and PEP 20.\n",
