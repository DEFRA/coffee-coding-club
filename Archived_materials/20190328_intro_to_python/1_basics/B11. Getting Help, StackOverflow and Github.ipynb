It also allows multiple people to collaborate on projects without things getting messy. Most people interact with Git and Github through the command line, however you can download <a href = \"https://desktop.github.com/\">Github desktop</a> which allows you to interact with Github via a point and click interface and for many people this is an easier way to get started with it.\n",

    "4) <b>Search Stackoverflow</b> ... and in most cases this will be via stackoverflow. Also using stackoverflow's search function is good too if the google search yielded little.<br/>\n",
    "5) <b>Module Documentation</b> Check the module documentation also! This varies in quality but answers can often be found therein.<br/>\n",
    "6) <b>Github</b> Sometimes if your problem is with a specific package, you can download a fork on Github. This is useful for Python 2/3 conflicts for example.<br/>\n",
    "7) <b>Ask Stackoverflow</b> If you still have nothing, then create a stackoverflow account and ask a question! That's what it's there for.<br/>\n",
