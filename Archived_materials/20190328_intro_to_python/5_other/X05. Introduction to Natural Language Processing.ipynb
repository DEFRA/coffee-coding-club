    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a way of approaching analysing text data. We won't be delving too much into the nuts and bolts of NLP since it's a massive area worthy of several hours/weeks/years of study depending upon your level of interest. This lesson is adapted from the excellent beginners tutorial available on <a href = \"https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/details/part-1-for-beginners-bag-of-words\">Kaggle</a> however there is a more in depth course available on <a href = \"https://www.coursera.org/course/nlpintro\">Coursera</a> should you wish to explore NLTK further."

However, one thing connecting these films is that they were both made in the 1980s. As such his friends may ask which year the film was made and conclude that Tom likes these films because they were made in the 1980s and reccomend he watch Footloose, something which he has no inclination to watch!\n",

For example, if there is a single yes/no question that accurately predicts the outputs 99% of the time, then that question allows us to “gain” a lot of information about our data. In order to measure how much information we gain, we introduce entropy which is a measure of uncertainty associated with our data. We can intuitively think that if a data set had only one label then we have a low entropy. So we would like to split our data in a way that minimizes the entropy.
