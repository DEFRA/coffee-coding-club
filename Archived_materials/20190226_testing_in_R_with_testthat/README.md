Automated testing in R using the testthat package
=================================================

Automated testing means your code is easier to write, easier to improve and easier to review. This presentation works as an introduction to the testing workflow, and how to implement it in R using the testthat package.

The first half of the presentation is an introduction to the general principles of test-driven development and how this will benefit your work.

The second half is a demonstration of the most commonly used package for automated testing in R, the **testthat** package.  I will work through an example where I use testthat in the development of an implementation of a simple greedy algorithm.

You should get something out of this presentation if you have:

 * little or no knowledge about test driven development and its benefits
 * little or no knowledge about the testthat package in R

In this folder you will find the following:

* *testing_in_R.html*: Slides on the test-driven development workflow
* *greedy.R*: An R script demonstration of the testthat package
* *test_greedy.R*: An example test suite using testthat used by *greedy.R*
* *computer_do_math.R*: A **really** simple example also used by *greedy.R*
