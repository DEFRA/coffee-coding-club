### Coffee and Coding: Connecting R to SQL

The main files are:
<br>
<br>
**Connecting_R_to_SQL.Rmd** 
<br>
**Connecting_R_to_SQL.html**
<br>
<br>
The first is the Rmarkdown script I used to create the presentation and can be viewed by opening on GitHub. However, you will only be able to run this code if you have access to the server and database specified.

The second, html, is the rendered presentation that can be read through. Unfortunately it is too large to view directly through GitHub.
<br>
<br>
Both files can be downloaded individually via these links:
