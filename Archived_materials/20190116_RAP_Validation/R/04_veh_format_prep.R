This is the keeper's address for privately kept vehicles or the company's registered address for company kept vehicles.

Vehicles are not necessarily driven or stored at their keeper's address."

Prior to December 2013 SORN declarations had to be renewed annually. From 16th December 2013, continuous SORN was introduced so a SORN declaration from then onwards lasts until the vehicle is re-taxed, sold, permanently exported or scrapped. This resulted in significantly higher year-on-year increases from 2013 Q4 onwards."
