Coffee and coding club

Hello, welcome to the Defra coffee and coding club GitHub. This is a repository for learning and contributing code, regardless of size or complexity. It also serves a second purpose for learning and practising version control with Git/GitHub in a practice environment, so we can try collaborating etc. 'safely'.

N.B. The repository is initially public, so please do not upload any datasets which are not for the public domain. Where possible, generate test data, or use already published data sets. For reproducibility, you might also consider using built in R datasets.

See this link for useful cheatsheets, official ones at the start with additional unofficial cheatsheets at the bottom for various libraries/subjects: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/.
