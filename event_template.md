## What is Coffee & Coding?

The aim of the Coffee & Coding meetups is to nurture, enable and encourage a vibrant, supportive and inclusive coding community at DEFRA. Coffee & Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within DEFRA who are interested in coding to share skills and knowledge, provide advice and guidance to each other and generally network and get to know each other. 

The format is generally 40 minutes for a presentation and questions to the presenter/s followed by 20 minutes Code Surgery. The presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using these methods. From time to time we will invite external speakers. The Code Surgery provides the opportunity for people to pose any coding related queries/ruminations/ideas to the gathered coding community.
